			"description": "Coca-Cola has always emphasized that its recipe is a tightly kept secret, reportedly stored in a high-security vault in Atlanta. However, in 2011, This American Life claimed to have found the recipe in a 130-year-old notebook belonging to the inventorâ€™s best friend. The formula listed 15 ingredients including cinnamon, neroli, coriander, and nutmeg oil. Coca-Cola maintained that the recipe was merely an older version, if it was genuine at all. The brand name Coca-Cola combines elements from two of its original ingredients: cocaine from the coca leaf and caffeine from the kola nut, with the alliteration adding to its market appeal. The logo has remained largely unchanged since its inception in 1886, still featuring the Spencerian script used at the start, with the most significant modification being the addition of a wavy underline in 1969. This information refers to an advertisement published in Family Circle magazine in July 1953."
